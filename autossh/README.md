# Home Assistant Add-on: AutoSSH

## About

Use SSH to make a tunnel from your local Home Assistant access available through a remote system.

This forms yet another way to make the Lovelace UI and other services accessible from other networks or the public internet.

This add-on is only useful to those with access to a publicly available SSH server and some administrative privileges on that system.
